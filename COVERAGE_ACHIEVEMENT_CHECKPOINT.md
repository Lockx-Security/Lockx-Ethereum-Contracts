## 🚀 METHODOLOGY THAT WORKED

### 📋 Systematic Approach
1. **Phase 1:** Target statements/functions/lines first
2. **Phase 2:** Professional test organization and cleanup
3. **Phase 3:** Permanent achievement documentation
4. **Phase 4:** Branch coverage optimization

### 🎯 Key Success Strategies
- **Harness Testing:** Used SignatureVerificationHarness for internal function testing
- **Coverage-Driven Development:** Used HTML coverage reports to identify exact missing lines
- **Targeted Testing:** Created specific tests for individual uncovered branches
- **Edge Case Focus:** Prioritized hard-to-reach error conditions and validations
- **Mock Strategy:** Comprehensive mock contracts for isolated testing

### 🔧 Critical Breakthrough Tests
- **final-statements-completion.spec.ts:** Hit fallback and AlreadyInitialized
- **swap-functionality-coverage.spec.ts:** Complete swapInLockbox coverage
- **validation-branch-coverage.spec.ts:** Error condition branches
- **comprehensive-branch-testing.spec.ts:** High-impact easy wins
