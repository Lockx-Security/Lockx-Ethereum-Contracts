## 🔍 What's Not Covered

The remaining 13.22% consists of:
- **Defensive programming code** that guards against impossible conditions
- **USDT approval reset edge case** (only executes when `currentAllowance != 0`)
- **Duplicate detection loops** (only execute on malicious input)
- **Error conditions** that represent proper security validation

**These are exactly what you want in production smart contracts** - defensive code that prevents edge cases and malicious behavior.
