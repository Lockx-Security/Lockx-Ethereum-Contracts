# Contributing

We welcome pull requests and feature proposals!  See the full [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for coding standards and the detailed workflow.  Below is a quick overview.

## Quick checklist

1. Fork → clone → `npm install`.  
2. Run all tests: `npm test && forge test -vv`.  
3. Format code: `npm run format` (Prettier + Solidity plugin).  
4. Ensure `npm run slither` shows no high-severity findings.  
5. Use Conventional Commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`…).  
6. Open a PR against `main`; CI must pass.

## Issues & feature requests

• Search existing issues first.  
• If proposing a new feature, explain _why_ and provide a minimal API sketch.  
• For security issues, **do not** open an issue – follow the [bug bounty process](bug-bounty.md).
