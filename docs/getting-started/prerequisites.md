# Prerequisites

Before interacting with the Lockx contracts you will need:

* **EVM wallet with EIP-712 support** – MetaMask ≥ v11, Rabby, Ledger (via MetaMask), Trezor Suite, etc.
* **Node.js ≥ 18** – for compiling contracts or running examples locally.
* **Package manager** – `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`.
* **Hardhat or Foundry basics** – optional but recommended for deployment and testing.

If you only want to _use_ Lockx on mainnet or a testnet you can skip the local tool-chain entirely and interact through the front-end or directly via Etherscan.

Continue to the [quick-start](quick-start.md) if you are ready to deploy a demo vault.
