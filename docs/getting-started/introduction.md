# Introduction

Lockx is a set of Ethereum smart contracts that let you lock, manage and withdraw multiple asset types with fine-grained security controls.  This guide explains the core idea and what you need before interacting with the contracts.

## Why use Lockx?

* Protect tokens from accidental transfers or compromised wallets.
* Separate day-to-day spending from long-term holdings.
* Enforce two-step withdrawals or key-rotation policies without relying on a custodian.

## Prerequisites

* A wallet that can sign EIP-712 messages (e.g. MetaMask, Rabby, Ledger via MetaMask).
* Node.js â‰¥ 18 if you plan to compile and test locally.
* Basic familiarity with Hardhat or Foundry for contract deployment.
