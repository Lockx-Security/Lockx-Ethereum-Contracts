# Why use Lockx?

Lockx provides vault-like assurances on-chain:

* **Asset segregation** – keep long-term holdings away from hot wallets.
* **Multi-asset support** – lock ETH, ERC-20s and NFTs in the same vault.
* **Self-custody security controls** – two-step withdrawals, key rotation and 2FA signing without trusting a third party.
* **Open, audited code** – contracts are Apache-2.0 and undergo continuous fuzz, invariant and static analysis.
