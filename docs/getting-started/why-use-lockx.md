# Why use Lockx?

Lockx addresses the two classic pain-points of crypto custody:

* **Accidental loss** – fat-finger transfers, wrong addresses, blind-signature drainers.
* **Malicious compromise** – seed-phrase leaks, malware, exchange shutdowns.

By storing assets inside a Lockbox NFT and requiring two independent key fractions to withdraw, Lockx lets you enjoy self-custody _without_ relying on extra hardware or custodians.

At a glance:

* **Protect tokens from accidental transfers or compromised wallets** – a second signature guard stops drainers.
* **Separate day-to-day spending from long-term holdings** – keep hot wallet balance low.
* **Enforce key rotation or time-based policies with no custodian** – signatures and nonces live on-chain.
* **Multi-asset vault** – hold ETH, ERC-20s and NFTs in one Lockbox.
* **Fully open-source** – Apache-2.0 licence, continuous fuzz, invariant and static analysis.
