## Detailed test analysis

### Core swap function analysis

```solidity
function swapInLockbox(
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes32 messageHash,
    bytes memory signature,
    address tokenIn,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,    // ✅ Slippage protection
    address target,
    bytes calldata data,
    bytes32 referenceId,
    uint256 signatureExpiry
) external nonReentrant
```

#### Key security features validated
1. **Signature Verification** - All signature tests pass
2. **Slippage Protection** - `minAmountOut` properly enforced
3. **Access Control** - Non-owner rejection working
4. **Balance Validation** - Insufficient balance properly caught
5. **Reentrancy Protection** - `nonReentrant` modifier active
6. **Input Validation** - Zero amounts and addresses rejected

### Gas cost analysis

| Operation Type | Gas Cost | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| **First ERC20→ERC20 Swap** | 230,352 | Includes token registration |
| **Subsequent Swaps** | ~108,784 | Optimized for existing tokens |
| **Multi-hop Swaps** | ~149,315 avg | Consistent per-swap cost |
| **Failed Swaps** | ~21,000 | Early validation saves gas |
| **Integration Operations** | 56,996 - 230,376 | Varies by operation type |

#### Performance analysis by swap size
- **Small Swaps (10 tokens)**: 230,304 gas
- **Medium Swaps (100 tokens)**: 108,748 gas  
- **Large Swaps (1,000 tokens)**: 108,772 gas
- **XLarge Swaps (5,000 tokens)**: 108,796 gas

#### First vs subsequent swaps
- **First Swap**: 230,352 gas (includes token registration)
- **Second Swap**: 108,784 gas (optimized path)
- **Third Swap**: 108,784 gas (consistent performance)

#### Gas analysis findings
- First swap costs more due to token registration
- Subsequent swaps have predictable costs
- Invalid operations fail early to save gas
- Multi-hop swaps don't have exponential costs

### Security audit results

#### Critical security features verified

1. **Signature Verification Security**
   - EIP-712 signature validation working correctly
   - Nonce progression prevents replay attacks
   - Signature expiry properly enforced
   - Message hash validation prevents tampering

2. **Access Control Security**
   - Only lockbox owner can execute swaps
   - Signature must be from authorized lockbox key
   - No unauthorized access vectors found

3. **Slippage Protection**
   - `minAmountOut` parameter properly enforced
   - Swaps revert if output below minimum
   - Prevents value extraction attacks

4. **Balance Accounting Security**

   - No double-spending possible
   - Proper cleanup on token removal

5. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - `nonReentrant` modifier active on all entry points
   - No callback vulnerabilities found

#### Router interaction security

1. **Router validation**
   - Zero address routers properly rejected
   - Failed router calls properly handled
   - No router whitelist needed (user choice)

2. **Approval pattern security**
   - Just-in-time approval for exact amounts
   - Proper cleanup after swap completion
   - USDT-compatible approval flow

3. **Balance verification**
   - Actual balance changes measured and validated
   - Excess spending events emitted for monitoring
   - Minimum output validation prevents theft
