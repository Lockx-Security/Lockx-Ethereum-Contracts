# Wallet attack protection

Even if your **hot wallet** is compromised, Lockx prevents an attacker from draining your assets.  The defence comes from four independent layers:

| Threat | How Lockx mitigates it |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Private key / seed-phrase leak | Assets live inside a **soul-bound Lockbox NFT**.  Withdrawals need a separate Lockx key (derived via EIP-712 or key-fraction) so the attacker needs two keys, not one. |
| Signature-phishing pop-ups | The contract only accepts **structured EIP-712 signatures** generated by the Lockx key, not arbitrary `eth_sign` blobs.  Critical fields (amounts, recipient, chainId, deadline) are explicit in the message so phishing sites cannot hide malicious data. |
| Wallet drainer contracts | Lockboxes are soul-bound; they cannot be `transferFrom`-ed.  To move assets you must call the Lockx contract and present a valid EIP-712 signature. |
| Malicious airdrops / surprise tokens | Only the owner can deposit into a Lockbox, and tokens inside cannot call arbitrary code.  Random airdrops therefore cannot compromise the vault. |

!!! note "No proprietary infrastructure"
    Lockx relies solely on open Ethereum standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, EIP-712).  There is no off-chain oracle or proprietary JS SDK required, so assets remain accessible even if the front-end is offline.


If your hot wallet is compromised, funds inside Lockx stay safe because an attacker needs *either* the second-factor signature or to wait out the time lock. You can rotate keys or cancel the lock before that.
