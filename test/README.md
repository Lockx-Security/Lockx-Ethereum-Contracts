### Viewing Coverage Report

After running coverage, open the HTML report:
```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

## Test Structure

Each test file follows this structure:
```typescript
describe('Contract/Feature Name', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Deploy contracts
    // Mint tokens
    // Set approvals
  });

  describe('Specific Feature', () => {
    it('should test success case', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should revert on error case', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Key Test Scenarios

### 1. Lockbox Creation
- ETH lockboxes
- ERC20 lockboxes
- ERC721 lockboxes
- Batch creation
- Zero address validation
- Insufficient ETH validation

### 2. Asset Deposits
- ETH deposits
- ERC20 deposits (including fee-on-transfer)
- ERC721 deposits (direct and via safeTransferFrom)
- Batch deposits
- Array management

### 3. Asset Withdrawals
- ETH withdrawals
- ERC20 withdrawals
- ERC721 withdrawals
- Batch withdrawals
- Balance validation
- Array cleanup

### 4. Signature Verification
- EIP-712 signature validation
- Nonce management
- Expiry validation
- Signature reuse prevention
- Invalid signer rejection

### 5. Special Operations
- Key rotation

- Metadata management
- Interface support

### 6. Swap Recipient Functionality (NEW - v2.3.0)
- ERC20→ERC20 swaps with external recipient
- ETH→ERC20 swaps with external recipient  
- ERC20→ETH swaps with external recipient
- Multiple recipients in consecutive swaps
- Backward compatibility (address(0) credits lockbox)
- Event emission validation (privacy-preserving)
- Signature tampering prevention

### 7. Edge Cases
- Fee-on-transfer tokens
- ETH transfer failures
- Array gaps handling
- Non-existent token operations
- Access control validation

## Analysis of Uncovered Branches

### Remaining Uncovered Branches (Strategic Analysis)

**Easily Achievable (Targeted by our tests):**
- Array mismatch conditions in batch operations ✅ 
- Error validation branches ✅
- Interface support checks ✅ 
- Empty operation validations ✅
- Soulbound transfer restrictions ✅

**Complex/Impractical (Require extensive infrastructure):**
- Advanced swap router integrations (16+ branches in Withdrawals.sol)
- Complex signature verification edge cases
- Defensive checks for malicious contract interactions
- Mathematical edge cases in array operations

**Security Note:** Uncovered branches primarily represent:
1. Defensive validations for edge cases
2. Complex DeFi integration paths
3. Impossible scenarios under normal operation

These do not indicate security vulnerabilities but rather comprehensive defensive programming.
