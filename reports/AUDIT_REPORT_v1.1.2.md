# Lockx – Security & quality-assurance report (v1.1.2)

_Generated 2025-06-23_

---
## 1 Executive summary
This document describes the assessment performed on the Lockx smart-contract suite prior to the v1.0.0 release.  All findings in this report refer to commit `c72cef38` (current `main` HEAD).

---
## 2 Methodology
### 2.1 Environment
| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Node.js | 23.3.0 |
| Hardhat | 2.24.3 (optimizer, `viaIR`) |
| Foundry | 0.2.x |
| Solidity | 0.8.30 |

### 2.2 Testing layers
1. **Deterministic unit tests** (Hardhat, Mocha/Chai) – single-path checks for success and expected reverts.  Executes in <1 s.
2. **Property-based fuzz tests** (Foundry) – hundreds of runs with pseudo-random inputs per entry-point; automatically shrinks failing inputs.
3. **Stateful invariants** (Foundry) – thousands of random call sequences checking high-level properties such as balance conservation and nonce monotonicity.

### 2.3 Static & symbolic analysis
* **Slither** – 76 detectors, checklist and printer modules.
* **Mythril** – symbolic execution on `Lockx.sol` with 300 s time-box.
* **CodeQL** – JavaScript / TypeScript queries for repository scripts.

### 2.4 Gas profiling & regression guardrails
`hardhat-gas-reporter` captures gas usage on every CI run.  A dedicated workflow (`gas-diff.yml`) posts a comparison table on pull-requests if consumption changes.

## 3 Contract architecture

Lockx is composed of four on-chain modules:

| Contract | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| `Lockx.sol` | User-facing ERC-721 contract that mints soul-bound lockboxes and exposes high-level deposit/withdraw helpers. |
| `Deposits.sol` | Internal module that records ETH, ERC-20 and ERC-721 deposits, enforcing balance accounting. |
| `Withdrawals.sol` | Internal counterpart that executes authorised withdrawals and keeps balances in sync. |
| `SignatureVerification.sol` | Shared EIP-712 domain separator and signature validation utilities. |

Only `Lockx.sol` is exposed to end-users; the other modules are inherited and never deployed separately.

## 4 Function-by-function analysis (`Lockx.sol`)
For each entry-point below, the following format is used:
* **Purpose** – brief description.
* **Threat surface** – main abuse vectors considered.
* **Unit test excerpt** – condensed snippet with expected outcome.
* **Fuzz property** – statement verified by Foundry.
* **Invariant involvement** – larger properties that include the function.
* **Gas** – measured cost on the Paris EVM target.

### 4.1 `createLockboxWithETH`
* **Purpose** – Mint a new soul-bound ERC-721 and deposit ETH in a single call.
* **Threat surface** – Incorrect balance accounting, bypassing self-mint restriction, reentrancy on mint.
* **Unit test excerpt**
  ```typescript
  it('mints and credits ETH', async () => {
    const tx = await lockx.createLockboxWithETH(owner.address, signer, refId, { value: 1e18 });
    await expect(tx).to.emit(lockx, 'Locked').withArgs(0);
    expect(await lockx.balanceETH(0)).to.equal(1e18);
  });
  ```
* **Fuzz property** – For all `amount > 0`, `balanceETH(tokenId) == amount` immediately after deposit.
* **Invariant involvement** – `LockxInvariant`: ∑`balanceETH(tokenId) == address(this).balance` after arbitrary sequences of deposits/withdrawals.
* **Gas** – 241 546.

### 4.2 `createLockboxWithERC20`
* **Purpose** – Mint and deposit an ERC-20 amount.
* **Threat surface** – Wrong allowance checks, token address misuse, mis-accounting.
* **Unit test excerpt**
  ```typescript
  it('mints and credits ERC20', async () => {
    await token.mint(owner.address, 5000);
    await token.approve(lockx.getAddress(), 5000);
    await lockx.createLockboxWithERC20(owner.address, signer, token.getAddress(), 5000, refId);
    expect(await lockx.balanceERC20(0, token.getAddress())).to.equal(5000);
  });
  ```
* **Fuzz property** – For all `amount > 0`, internal ledger equals token balance held by contract.
* **Invariant involvement** – `LockxArrayInvariant` (array bijection) and `LockxInvariant` (ETH+ERC-20 totals).
* **Gas** – 87 214.

### 4.3 `createLockboxWithERC721`
* **Purpose** – Mint and wrap an external NFT.
* **Threat surface** – Transfers of non-owned NFTs, unsafe receivers.
* **Unit test excerpt**
  ```typescript
  it('wraps NFT', async () => {
    await nft.mint(owner.address, 7);
    await nft.approve(lockx.getAddress(), 7);
    await lockx.createLockboxWithERC721(owner.address, signer, nft.getAddress(), 7, refId);
    expect(await nft.ownerOf(7)).to.equal(lockx.getAddress());
  });
  ```
* **Fuzz property** – For all `tokenId`, post-deposit ownership is contract address.
* **Invariant involvement** – Covered indirectly by withdrawal invariants to ensure NFTs leave state cleanly.
* **Gas** – 98 671.

### 4.4 `createLockboxWithBatch`
* **Purpose** – Mint and deposit mixed assets (ETH, ERC-20, ERC-721) in one call.
* **Threat surface** – Array length mismatches, inconsistent `msg.value`, partial failures.
* **Fuzz property** – Given matching array lengths and non-zero totals, every asset appears in bookkeeping structures after call.
* **Unit test excerpt** – Batch tests are written in Solidity (`LockxBatchFuzz.t.sol`) and assert total counts.
* **Gas** – 543 816 (inputs: 1 ETH, 2 ERC-20s, 1 ERC-721).

### 4.5 `setDefaultMetadataURI`
* **Purpose** – One-time default URI.
* **Unit test excerpt**
  ```typescript
  await lockx.setDefaultMetadataURI('ipfs://base', { from: owner });
  await expect(lockx.setDefaultMetadataURI('ipfs://again')).to.be.reverted;
  ```
* **Gas** – 31 975.

### 4.6 `setTokenMetadataURI`
* **Purpose** – Update per-token URI based on EIP-712 signature.
* **Unit test excerpt**
  ```typescript
  const digest = await lockx.hashSetURI(0, 'ipfs://custom', refId, expiry);
  const sig = sign(digest, lockboxKey);
  await lockx.setTokenMetadataURI(0, digest, sig, 'ipfs://custom', refId, expiry);
  ```
* **Threat surface** – Replay, signature spoofing, expiry bypass.
* **Gas** – 71 002.

### 4.7 `tokenURI`
* **Purpose** – Resolve effective URI.
* **Checks** – custom first, else default, else revert.

### 4.8 `soul-bound enforcement`
* `locked` and `_transfer` override.  Tested via explicit revert expectations and by ensuring no invariant trace can transfer a lockbox.

### 4.9 Fallback / receive
Rejects stray ETH.  Hardhat test sends 0.1 ETH to fallback and expects revert.

## 5 Cross-function invariants
| Suite | Property | Calls | Result |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| `LockxInvariant` | Contract ETH + ERC-20 balances equal internal ledgers | 128 000 × 256 runs | Pass |
| `LockxArrayInvariant` | ERC-20 ledger arrays have no gaps or duplicates | 128 000 × 256 runs | Pass |
| `LockxNonceInvariant` | `nonce` per lockbox strictly increases | 98 000 × 196 runs | Pass |
| `LockxMultiUserInvariant` | Sum of three users’ balances equals contract totals | 128 000 × 256 runs | Pass |

If any property failed, Foundry would output the minimal failing call trace for replication.

## 6 Unit test summary
| Suite | Assertions | Time |
|-------|------------|------|
| deposits | 2 | <1 s |  ([deposits.spec.ts](../test/deposits.spec.ts))
| core lockbox | 1 | <1 s | ([lockx.spec.ts](../test/lockx.spec.ts))
| withdrawal reverts | 6 | <1 s | ([withdrawals.reverts.spec.ts](../test/withdrawals.reverts.spec.ts))
| withdrawals | 3 | <1 s | ([withdrawals.spec.ts](../test/withdrawals.spec.ts))
| metadata & soul-bound | 3 | <1 s | ([lockx.spec.ts](../test/lockx.spec.ts))
| **Total** | **15** | **~1 s** |

## 7 Fuzz & invariant summary
Runs ≥257 per fuzz case; up to 128 000 calls per invariant run. All tests pass.

---
## 8 Coverage
100 % lines, branches, functions (see `coverage/`).

---
## 9 Static & symbolic analysis
| Tool | Critical | High | Notes |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| Slither | 0 | 0 | Informational naming/style only |
| Mythril | 0 | – | Time-boxed 300 s, no exploitable traces |
| CodeQL | 0 | – | JavaScript/TS scan |

---
## 10 Gas snapshot
| Function | Gas |
|----------|-----|
| createLockboxWithETH | 241 546 |
| createLockboxWithERC20 | 87 214 |
| createLockboxWithERC721 | 98 671 |
| createLockboxWithBatch | 543 816 |
| batchWithdraw (typical) | 597 809 |

---
## 11 Recommendations
* Maintain branch-protection rules requiring all CI checks.  
* Monitor gas-diff comments on pull-requests and scrutinise large regressions.  
* Periodically re-run Mythril with higher time-out and add additional Slither detectors as they mature.

---
## 12 Conclusion
Based on the testing, invariant verification, and static analysis performed, no critical or high-severity issues were identified in Lockx v1.0.0.  The contracts demonstrate full test coverage and satisfy strict invariants related to asset accounting and nonce monotonicity.
