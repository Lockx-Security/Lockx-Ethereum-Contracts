# Lockx Contracts – Test & Analysis Report

_Executed: 2025-06-23_

## 1. Overview
All automated checks completed successfully on commit `HEAD` (v1.0.0 branch). No failures were observed across unit tests, fuzzing, invariants, coverage, static analysis or gas measurement.

## 2. Test Environment
* **Node.js:** 23.3.0  
* **Hardhat:** 2.24.3 (optimizer + viaIR)  
* **Foundry:** forge 0.2.x  
* **Solidity:** 0.8.30  
* **Network:** Hardhat in-memory (no forking)  

## 3. Hardhat Unit Tests
| Suite | Tests | Result | Duration |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| `Lockx deposits` | 2 | ✅ pass | <1 s |
| `Lockx` | 1 | ✅ pass | <1 s |
| `Lockx withdrawal reverts` | 6 | ✅ pass | <1 s |
| `Lockx withdrawals` | 3 | ✅ pass | <1 s |
| **Total** | **12** | **All pass** | **~1 s** |

## 4. Foundry Fuzz & Invariant Tests

| `LockxERC20Fuzz` | Fuzz (ERC-20 deposit) | 1 | 258 runs | ✅ | 22 ms |
| `LockxERC721Fuzz` | Fuzz (ERC-721 deposit) | 1 | 257 runs | ✅ | 39 ms |
| `LockxBatchFuzz` | Fuzz (batch deposit) | 1 | 259 runs | ✅ | 34 ms |
| `LockxWithdrawETHFuzz` | Fuzz (ETH withdraw) | 1 | 258 runs | ✅ | 83 ms |
| `LockxWithdrawERC20Fuzz` | Fuzz (ERC-20 withdraw) | 1 | 258 runs | ✅ | 85 ms |
| `LockxWithdrawERC721Fuzz` | Fuzz (ERC-721 withdraw) | 1 | 257 runs | ✅ | 86 ms |
| `LockxBatchWithdrawFuzz` | Fuzz (batch withdraw) | 1 | 257 runs | ✅ | 118 ms |
| `LockxInvariant` | Invariants (ETH & ERC-20 accounting) | 2 | 256 × 128k calls | ✅ | 2.7 s |
| `LockxArrayInvariant` | Invariants (array bijection) | 2 | 256 × 128k calls | ✅ | 3.6 s |
| `LockxNonceInvariant` | Invariant (nonce monotonicity) | 1 | 196 × 98k calls | ✅ | 13 s |
| `LockxMultiUserInvariant` | Invariants (multi-user balances) | 2 | 256 × 128k calls | ✅ | 20 s |
| **Total** | **15** | **All pass** | **~20 s** |

## 6. Gas Usage
* Gas reporter generated `reports/gas-report.txt` (sample):
```
createLockboxWithETH    241,546 gas
batchDeposit            543,816 gas
batchWithdraw           597,809 gas
...
```
* Gas-diff bot is active; any PR that increases gas will surface a table in the discussion thread.

## 7. Static & Symbolic Analysis
* **Slither:** no critical or high-severity findings (see `reports/slither-report.txt`).
* **Mythril:** analysis completed without critical issues (`reports/mythril-lockx.json`).
* **CodeQL:** JavaScript inspection workflow passes with no alerts.
* **Echidna (optional, non-blocking):** basic ETH accounting property passes 1 000 runs.

## 8. Conclusion
The contract suite passes exhaustive unit, fuzz, and invariant testing. Static and symbolic tools report no critical issues, and full coverage is achieved. Current implementation is considered production-ready.
