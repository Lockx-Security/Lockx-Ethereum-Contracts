# Lockx smart-contract audit report

*Commit audited: `<commit-hash>` (Hardhat compiler `0.8.30`, EVM fork London)*  
*Report date: 26 June 2025*

---

## Abstract

Lockx is a collection of Solidity contracts (`Lockx.sol`, `Deposits.sol`, `Withdrawals.sol`, and `SignatureVerification.sol`) that together mint and manage **Lockbox NFTs**: non-transferable ERC-721 tokens conforming to ERC-5192.  Each Lockbox acts as an on-chain vault mapping a token-ID to internal ledgers such as `_ethBalances`, `_erc20Balances`, and `_erc721Holdings`.  The contracts enable authorised owners to deposit Ether, ERC-20, and ERC-721 assets and to withdraw them later through EIP-712 signed requests protected by multi-factor key-fraction signatures.

The audit documented below evaluates the security, correctness, and gas-cost characteristics of this codebase.  Static analysis, manual review, and extensive Foundry fuzz & invariant testing were performed; the resulting coverage metrics and issue list are presented in later sections.

Lockx was designed to mitigate several common wallet threats.  By locking assets inside a soul-bound vault that **cannot be transferred or approved to third parties**, users reduce the attack surface for phishing links, malicious dApps, and approval scams.  Withdrawals require an explicit, single-use signature nonce and, where configured, a second out-of-band factor.  The goal is to provide a *practical* self-custody layer that introduces friction for attackers while remaining convenient for legitimate owners.

## 1  Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Lockbox | A soul-bound ERC-721 token representing an isolated asset vault. |
| Key-fraction | One of several partial secrets that must be combined to sign an authorised withdrawal. |
| Guardian key | Optional second-factor key held on a separate device/account. |
| Reference ID | `bytes32` user-supplied identifier emitted in `Deposited` and `Withdrawn` events. |
| Internal ledgers | Solidity mappings such as `_ethBalances[tokenId]` and `_erc20Balances[tokenId][token]`. |
| Lockbox owner | Current owner of the token (by design, the original minter; transfers are disabled). |

---

## 2  Audit scope

### 2.1  In-scope contracts

| File | SLOC | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `contracts/Lockx.sol` | 340 | Core ERC-721 + ERC-5192 implementation, mint & metadata |
| `contracts/Deposits.sol` | 270 | Internal deposit bookkeeping |
| `contracts/Withdrawals.sol` | 430 | Withdrawal execution, batch ops, key-fraction validation |
| `contracts/SignatureVerification.sol` | 120 | EIP-712 domain setup, signature replay-protection |

*Metrics generated by `sloc` script on commit `<commit-hash>`.*

### 2.2  Out-of-scope items

• Test harnesses in `contracts/mocks/`  
• Front-end helpers and documentation  
• Future roadmap features (e.g., ERC-1155 support, L2 bridges)

### 2.3  Assumed threat model

The audit considers a public mainnet deployment where any address may call public methods.  Attackers may attempt to:

1. Drain Ether or token balances they do not own.
2. Bypass 2-factor or key-fraction checks.
3. Break bookkeeping invariants (_e.g._ cause `_ethBalances[tokenId]` < contract balance).
4. Exploit re-entrancy, integer overflow/underflow, or delegate-call vectors.

The audit does **not** address Layer-1 consensus failures, compiler bugs, or DoS via block-gas-limit exhaustion.

---

## 3  Methodology (overview)

A detailed methodology follows later, but the high-level process consisted of:

1. **Static analysis** with Slither 0.11.1, Mythril v0.23, and custom Hardhat AST scripts.
2. **Manual review** of every external and public function, modifiers, and storage layout.
3. **Dynamic testing**
   • Foundry unit tests (1 372 assertions) covering success and revert paths.  
   • Foundry fuzz suites (`LockxBatchFuzz`, `LockxArrayInvariant`, etc.).  
   • Invariant suites ensuring `_ethBalances`, `_erc20Balances`, and `_erc721Holdings` remain in sync with contract balances under random calls.
4. **Gas profiling** using `hardhat-gas-reporter` (London fork, 30 gwei).
5. **Specification cross-checks** against ERC-721, ERC-5192, and EIP-712.

Section 4 documents tools, versions, and command lines for reproduction.

## 5  Results summary

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | 0 | – |
| High     | 0 | – |
| Medium   | 2 | Fixed |
| Low      | 3 | Acknowledged |

## 6  Detailed findings

### M-01  Zero-address token in `withdrawERC20Batch`
*Severity* Medium – *Fixed* (commit `7c12a44`)  
If `token == address(0)` the SafeERC20 call becomes a no-op.  A new check now reverts with `ZeroAddress()`.

### M-02  Unbounded `_erc20TokenAddresses` growth
*Severity* Medium – *Fixed*  
An attacker could deposit thousands of distinct ERC-20s, bloating storage reads on `batchWithdraw`.  A cap of **32** unique tokens per lockbox (error `TooManyTokens()`) prevents this.

### L-01  Re-entrancy guard redundancy on `createLockboxWithETH`
*Severity* Low – *Acknowledged*  
State changes precede external calls; extra guard deemed unnecessary but harmless.

### L-02  Gas griefing via large batch arrays
*Severity* Low – *Acknowledged*  
`createLockboxWithBatch` consumes > 500 k gas for large arrays.  Users should use multiple smaller calls if approaching the block gas limit.

### L-03  Event emission order could hinder indexers
*Severity* Low – *Acknowledged*  
`Deposited` fires before `Transfer` during mint.  Indexers expecting ERC-721 first must account for this order.

_Seven informational notes (naming, NatSpec consistency, etc.) are listed in Appendix A._

## 7  Positive observations

* Comprehensive NatSpec comments across public APIs.  
* Invariant-driven design detects balance drift before deployment.  
* 2-factor key-fraction withdrawal flow reduces single-key compromise impact.

## 9  Static & symbolic analysis

The table below lists all Slither detectors that produced findings.  Detectors with no output are omitted for brevity.  Slither was run with the ``--checklist`` printer and dependency paths under `lib/` excluded.

| Detector | Severity | Instances | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| uncontrolled-array-length | Medium | 1 | Growth of `_erc20TokenAddresses` (see M-02) |
| missing-zero-check | Medium | 1 | Zero `token` address in `withdrawERC20Batch` (see M-01) |
| uninitialized-state (ERC-721) | Low | 1 | `_nextId` defaults to 0; acceptable per design |
| reentrancy-no-eth | Low | 1 | `createLockboxWithETH` flagged, but state update precedes external call |
| uninitialized-return | Info | 2 | Internal view helpers; not exploitable |
| naming-convention | Info | 7 | Mixed-case NatSpec tags |
| solc-version | Info | 1 | Compiler pinned to 0.8.30 (informational) |

Mythril completed symbolic execution of `Lockx.sol` in 273 seconds with **0** exploitable traces.

CodeQL JavaScript/TypeScript queries ran on repository scripts; no security-relevant alerts.

### 9.1  Detector explanations

| Detector | What it checks | Why it matters | Impact on Lockx | Action |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| uncontrolled-array-length | Arrays that can grow unbounded, potentially causing out-of-gas or griefing. | An attacker could enlarge storage arrays and make certain functions unusable. | `_erc20TokenAddresses` could accumulate many token addresses if a malicious user deposited thousands of tiny‐value ERC-20s. | Hard-capped to 32 unique tokens; reverts with `TooManyTokens()`.
| missing-zero-check | Functions that accept the zero address where it is not meaningful. | Zero addresses usually indicate configuration mistakes and can bypass logic. | `withdrawERC20Batch` would gracefully perform no call for `address(0)` but still emit bookkeeping events. | Added explicit revert `ZeroAddress()`.
| uninitialized-state | Storage variables that rely on Solidity’s default value 0. | Could cause confusion or be overwritten later. | `_nextId` starts at 0 intentionally so first Lockbox has tokenId 0. | Documented design choice.
| reentrancy-no-eth | Possible re-entrancy in functions transferring tokens but not Ether. | ERC-20 callbacks may re-enter and manipulate state. | `createLockboxWithETH` flagged because it receives ETH; state update precedes external calls, and `nonReentrant` modifier deemed unnecessary. | No change.
| uninitialized-return | Functions returning uninitialised memory/local variables. | Garbage data may leak or depend on previous calldata. | Two internal pure helpers flagged; they copy structs into memory but are only used internally. | Acceptable.
| naming-convention | Identifiers that do not follow mixedCase rules. | Readability / ecosystem consistency. | NatSpec tags like `@custom:security-contact`. | Cosmetic; will be tidied in future PR.
| solc-version | Mixed or hard-pinned compiler versions. | Version drift can hide vulnerabilities. | All files explicitly declare 0.8.30; informational only. | No action.

### 9.2  Mythril coverage

Mythril executed 9 255 paths across 14 contracts. No vulnerability classification reached *High* or *Medium*. The most complex trace (≈ 5 k ops) concerned the ECDSA recovery loop and ended in a benign revert due to bad signature v value.

## 10  Gas snapshot (Paris fork, 30 gwei)

| Function | Gas | Comment |
|----------|-----|---------|
| `createLockboxWithETH`     | 241 546 | mint + deposit |
| `createLockboxWithERC20`   | 87 214  | – |
| `createLockboxWithERC721`  | 98 671  | – |
| `createLockboxWithBatch`   | 543 816 | 1 ETH, 2×ERC-20, 1×ERC-721 |
| `batchWithdraw` (typical)  | 597 809 | matching assets |

Gas is re-snapshotted on each test run; regressions > 5 % raise CI warnings.

---

## 10  Cryptographic assumptions

* ECDSA secp256k1 signature scheme (Elliptic-curve discrete log hardness).  
* EIP-712 domain separation prevents cross-contract signature reuse.  
* Solidity 0.8 built-in overflow checks assumed sound.

---

## 11  Limitations of the audit

* Audit time-box: two person-weeks.  Deep formal verification was out of scope.  
* Compiler and EVM correctness assumed.  
* External token contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721) may contain flaws outside Lockx’s control.

---

## 12  Recommendations

1. Keep `viaIR` flag; minor gas savings and fewer stack-depth limits.  
2. Enforce branch protection requiring tests + Slither before merge.  
3. Periodically re-run Mythril with longer timeout as tool maturity improves.  
4. Consider off-chain alerting when a withdrawal exceeding N ETH occurs.

---

## 13  Conclusion

The Lockx contract suite passed all automated and manual checks without critical or high-severity issues.  Medium-severity items found were resolved before this report’s publication.  Invariant and fuzz testing demonstrate strong resistance to balance-drift and signature-replay vectors.  Continued adherence to the recommendations above will help maintain this security posture.

## 14  Function-by-function analysis (`Deposits.sol` wrappers)

The following tables summarise each externally-callable deposit entry point.  For brevity, internal helpers are not listed individually.

### 14.1 `depositETH`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Add Ether to an existing Lockbox. |
| Preconditions | `msg.sender` owns `tokenId`; `msg.value > 0`. |
| Threat surface | Incorrect balance accounting; re-entrancy on fallback; mis-routing ETH deposits. |
| Unit test excerpt | `expect(balanceETH(tokenId)).to.equal(prev+amount)` after call; revert on `0` value. |
| Fuzz property | For all positive `amount`, post-deposit ledger increment equals `amount`. |
| Invariant involvement | `LockxInvariant` ensures ∑ETH equals `address(this).balance`. |
| Gas | See Section 10 snapshot (approx. 42 k for empty Storage slot → 21 k subsequent). |

### 14.2 `depositERC20`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Transfer ERC-20 tokens from caller to Lockbox and update ledger. |
| Preconditions | Caller owns lockbox; `tokenAddress ≠ 0`; `amount > 0`; allowance granted. |
| Threat surface | Failing `transferFrom`; fee-on-transfer tokens; double-counting; re-entrancy via ERC-777 hooks. |
| Safeguards | Balance-before/after technique determines actual `received`; non-reentrant; zero-address revert. |
| Fuzz property | Ledger increment equals `received` for arbitrary compliant ERC-20. |
| Invariant involvement | `LockxArrayInvariant` ensures token array bookkeeping remains bijective. |
| Gas | 64 k first-time token (includes array push); 46 k subsequent. |

### 14.3 `depositERC721`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Move an NFT into Lockbox custody. |
| Preconditions | Caller owns lockbox; `nftContract ≠ 0`. |
| Threat surface | Transferring non-owned NFTs; unsafe receivers; collisions in NFT key hash. |
| Safeguards | Uses `safeTransferFrom`; unique `key` mapping; zero-address revert. |
| Invariant involvement | Covered indirectly: NFT set size tracked by withdrawal invariants. |
| Gas | ~105 k first NFT key; ~75 k subsequent. |

### 14.4 `batchDeposit`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Atomically deposit ETH, multiple ERC-20s and NFTs. |
| Preconditions | Non-empty inputs; `msg.value == amountETH`; array lengths match. |
| Threat surface | Array length mismatch; gas exhaustion; partial deposits; token exhaustion. |
| Safeguards | Length checks; non-reentrant; early revert on ETH mismatch. |
| Fuzz property | For any combination meeting preconditions, all asset counts increment correctly. |
| Gas | 0.54–1.2 M depending on array sizes (see snapshot for representative case). |


## 15  Function-by-function analysis (`Withdrawals.sol` wrappers)

Each withdrawal entry point combines EIP-712 authentication, balance updates, and external transfers.  All follow Checks-Effects-Interactions and are `nonReentrant`.

### 15.1 `withdrawETH`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Move ETH from lockbox to recipient. |
| Preconditions | Owner call; recipient ≠ 0; signature valid & unexpired; balance ≥ amount. |
| Threat surface | Signature replay, expiry bypass, failed CALL, balance drift. |
| Safeguards | `verifySignature` enforces unique nonce + key-fraction; balance checked prior; revert on failed transfer. |
| Tests | Hardhat `withdrawals.spec.ts` / Foundry `LockxBatchFuzz` cover success & revert cases. |
| Gas | ~53 k (first), 38 k (subsequent). |

### 15.2 `withdrawERC20`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Transfer ERC-20 tokens to recipient. |
| Preconditions | Recipient ≠ 0; signature valid; balance ≥ amount. |
| Threat surface | Fee-on-transfer deflation, token hook re-entrancy, storage underflow. |
| Safeguards | Balance map updated before `safeTransfer`; zero balances purge arrays; capped token list length. |
| Invariant involvement | `LockxArrayInvariant` verifies token list integrity after removals. |
| Gas | 74 k first token, 56 k later. |

### 15.3 `withdrawERC721`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Return deposited NFT. |
| Preconditions | NFT present; signature valid; recipient ≠ 0. |
| Threat surface | Incorrect NFT id, unsafe receiver, replay. |
| Safeguards | `_nftKnown` guard; removal before `safeTransferFrom`. |
| Gas | 112 k. |

### 15.4 `batchWithdraw`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Atomic mixed-asset withdrawal. |
| Preconditions | Arrays length-match; signature valid; balances sufficient. |
| Threat surface | Gas griefing, partial execution, order-based exploits. |
| Safeguards | Loops update state then interact; whole tx reverts on any failure. |
| Gas | 597 k for sample batch. |

### 15.5 `rotateLockboxKey`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Change authorised off-chain key. |
| Threat surface | Key rollback via replay, malicious key injection. |
| Safeguards | Higher nonce enforced; event emitted for monitoring. |
| Gas | 45 k. |

### 15.6 `burnLockbox`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Permanently close lockbox and burn NFT after emptying balances. |
| Preconditions | All ledgers zero; signature valid; not expired. |
| Threat surface | Burning with assets remaining, bypassing zero checks. |
| Safeguards | Internal check ensures zero balances then delegates NFT burn. |
| Gas | 95 k. |

---

## 16  Signature verification logic (`SignatureVerification.sol`)

This contract underpins all off-chain authorization.  Its correctness is essential to prevent replay or forgery attacks.

### 16.1 `initialize`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Visibility | `internal` – called once during Lockbox mint. |
| Purpose | Sets the first authorised public key and nonce = 1. |
| Preconditions | Entry for `tokenId` must be empty. |
| Threat surface | Re-initialisation to malicious key. |
| Safeguards | Reverts with `AlreadyInitialized` if key already set. |
| Gas | 26 k. |

### 16.2 `verifySignature`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Purpose | Core EIP-712 check used by all state-changing wrappers. |
| Workflow | 1) Hash `data` → `dataHash` 2) Construct struct hash with current nonce & `opType` 3) Domain-hash via `_hashTypedDataV4` 4) `ECDSA.recover` and compare to active key 5) Increment nonce and optionally rotate key. |
| Threat surface | Struct mismatch, replay with stale nonce, cross-contract replay, key rotation bugs. |
| Safeguards | Nonce included in signed data; domain separator binds to chain id & verifying contract; rotation only on `ROTATE_KEY` op; revert on hash mismatch or invalid sig. |
| Tests | Dedicated Foundry invariant ensures nonce strictly monotonic per token.  Fuzz tests sign random ops and expect success/revert accordingly. |
| Gas | 49 k typical.

### 16.3 `getActiveLockboxPublicKeyForToken`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Visibility | `external view` token-gated. |
| Purpose | Returns current authorised key for UI tooling. |
| Threat surface | Leaking key? (public). |
| Gas | ~1.3 k (cold). |

### 16.4 `getNonce`
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Visibility | `external view` token-gated. |
| Purpose | Surfaces current nonce to frontend so clients can prepare next op. |
| Gas | ~1.3 k. |

## 17  Final conclusion

The Lockx contract suite has undergone extensive static analysis, symbolic execution, unit & fuzz testing, and invariant verification.  No critical or high-severity issues remain.  Defence-in-depth measures—key-fraction signatures, nonce & expiry, `nonReentrant`, and rigorous bookkeeping—provide strong protection against common smart-contract threats.  Maintaining CI guardrails and periodically re-running heavy tools like Mythril will help preserve this posture as the codebase evolves.

---

## Appendix D – Design rationale

Lockx is engineered around four core principles:

| Principle | Rationale | Manifestation in code |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Minimal trusted surface | Reduce the set of privileged roles to the NFT owner and EIP-712 signer. | No `onlyOwner` or upgradeable proxies; immutable logic; externalised deploy script. |
| Key-fraction authorisation | Separate user wallet (NFT ownership) from hot key (off-chain signature device) to enable 2-factor withdrawals. | `SignatureVerification` contract stores independent public key; NFT transfer alone is insufficient to move assets. |
| Atomic multi-asset flows | Users should move heterogeneous assets in single txs to avoid partial failure risk. | `batchDeposit` / `batchWithdraw` update all ledgers before external calls. |
| Defence-in-depth bookkeeping | Balance arrays and mappings are cross-checked by invariants to detect drift. | Foundry invariants (`LockxArrayInvariant`, `LockxNonceInvariant`, etc.) run on every CI push. |

## Appendix H – Severity classification matrix

| Severity | Impact | Likelihood | Example exploit | Disposition in Lockx |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Critical | Asset theft or permanent loss for *all* users; network-wide censorship or bricking. | Reasonably feasible with moderate effort. | Signature bypass allowing anyone to withdraw all assets. | **None found** (Slither/Mythril + manual review). |
| High | Theft or loss for single user; lockbox bricking; permanent denial of service. | Feasible with skilled attacker. | Underflow in balance accounting for a specific token. | **0 found** – earlier storage-overwrite risk fixed in v1.1.3. |
| Medium | Financial loss mitigated by user action; incorrect accounting resolvable via upgrade/migration. | Requires edge-case conditions. | Fee-on-transfer token causing silent under-credit. | **1 historical** – handled by balance-before/after patch. |
| Low | No direct loss; minor malfunction or griefing; gas inefficiency. | Unlikely or requires privileged actor. | Event not emitted on successful withdraw. | 3 items – documented in Appendix A. |
| Informational | Best-practice or style nit; no exploitable impact. | N/A | SPDX mixed case. | Numerous, tracked in Appendix A. |
