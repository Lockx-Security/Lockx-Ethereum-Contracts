# Lockx Contracts – Detailed Test & Audit Report

_Generated: 2025-06-23_

---
## 1. Scope
This report covers the **v1.0.0** release of the Lockx contracts. It links each public-facing function in `contracts/Lockx.sol` to the tests and analyses that exercise it, then summarises the results of all quality-assurance steps.

---
## 2. Environment
| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Node.js | 23.3.0 |
| Hardhat | 2.24.3 (optimizer, viaIR) |
| Foundry (forge) | 0.2.x |
| Solidity | 0.8.30 |
| Network | Hardhat in-memory |

---
## 3. Function Coverage Matrix (`Lockx.sol`)
| Function | Purpose | Primary Tests | Additional Checks |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| `createLockboxWithETH` | Mint lockbox and deposit ETH | `deposits.spec.ts`, `LockxFuzz.t.sol`, `LockxWithdrawETHFuzz.t.sol`, `LockxInvariant.t.sol`, `LockxMultiUserInvariant.t.sol` | Slither, gas reporter |
| `createLockboxWithERC20` | Mint and deposit ERC-20 | `deposits.spec.ts`, `LockxERC20Fuzz.t.sol`, `LockxWithdrawERC20Fuzz.t.sol`, `LockxInvariant.t.sol`, `LockxArrayInvariant.t.sol`, `LockxMultiUserInvariant.t.sol` | Slither, gas reporter |
| `createLockboxWithERC721` | Mint and deposit ERC-721 | `deposits.spec.ts`, `LockxERC721Fuzz.t.sol`, `LockxWithdrawERC721Fuzz.t.sol` | Slither |
| `createLockboxWithBatch` | Mint and batch-deposit mixed assets | `LockxBatchFuzz.t.sol`, `LockxBatchWithdrawFuzz.t.sol` | Gas reporter |
| `setDefaultMetadataURI` | One-time default URI | `metadata.spec.ts` *(implicit)* | N/A |
| `setTokenMetadataURI` | Owner-only URI update via EIP-712 | `metadata.spec.ts` | Signature-verification unit tests |
| `tokenURI` | Resolve metadata URI | Covered by metadata tests | N/A |
| `locked` | Soul-bound flag (ERC-5192) | `soulbound.spec.ts` *(implicit)* | Invariants ensure no transfers |
| `_transfer` (override) | Disabled transfer | `soulbound.spec.ts`, fuzzers indirectly | Slither |
| Fallback / receive | Reject stray ETH calls | `fallback.spec.ts` *(implicit)* | Found by Slither "UnusedReceiveEther" |

> **Note**: Withdrawal logic lives in `Withdrawals.sol`. Those functions are fully fuzzed (`LockxWithdraw*`, `LockxBatchWithdrawFuzz`) and participate in every invariant suite.

## 4. Unit Test Summary (Hardhat)
| Suite | Tests | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| deposits | 2 | ✅ |
| core lockbox | 1 | ✅ |
| withdrawal reverts | 6 | ✅ |
| withdrawals | 3 | ✅ |
| metadata & soul-bound | 3 | ✅ |
| **Total** | **15** | **100 % pass** |

_Total runtime: ~1 s._

---
## 5. Fuzz & Invariant Summary (Foundry)
| Suite | Kind | Result | Key Assertions |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| `LockxFuzz` | ETH deposit | ✅ | Deposited balance == contract balance |
| `LockxERC20Fuzz` | ERC-20 deposit | ✅ | Mapping updated correctly |
| `LockxERC721Fuzz` | ERC-721 deposit | ✅ | NFT held by contract |
| `LockxBatchFuzz` | Batch deposit | ✅ | All assets credited |
| `LockxWithdraw*` | Withdraw fuzz | ✅ | Post-withdraw balances zero |
| `LockxBatchWithdrawFuzz` | Batch withdraw | ✅ | Mixed withdrawal succeeds |
| `LockxInvariant` | ETH/ERC-20 accounting | ✅ | Internal accounting == on-chain balances |
| `LockxArrayInvariant` | Array bijection | ✅ | No duplicates / gaps |
| `LockxNonceInvariant` | Nonce ordering | ✅ | Nonces only increase |
| `LockxMultiUserInvariant` | Multi-user isolation | ✅ | Σ(user balances) == contract balance |

_Fuzz runs: ≥257 per test    •    Invariant calls: up to 128 000 per run_

## 6. Coverage
All lines, branches, and functions in `contracts/**/*.sol` are executed at least once.
```text
Statements : 100 %
Branches   : 100 %
Functions  : 100 %
Lines      : 100 %
```
HTML artefacts in `coverage/`.

## 7. Gas Snapshot
Sample from `reports/gas-report.txt`:
| Function | Gas |
|----------|-----|
| createLockboxWithETH | 241 546 |
| batchDeposit | 543 816 |
| batchWithdraw | 597 809 |
| withdrawERC20 | 87 214 |
| withdrawERC721 | 98 671 |

The gas-diff workflow alerts on any regression in pull-requests.

## 8. Static / Symbolic Analysis
| Tool | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Slither** | 0 critical / 0 high | Informational items only (naming, style) |
| **Mythril** | 0 critical | Time-boxed to 300 s; no exploitable paths found |
| **CodeQL** | 0 alerts | JavaScript/TS scan for project scripts |
| **Echidna** | Pass | ETH accounting property – 1 000 tests |

---
## 9. Conclusion
Every public entry-point of `Lockx.sol` is covered by unit, fuzz, and/or invariant tests. Full line and branch coverage is achieved. Independent static and symbolic analysis tools report **no critical issues**. Gas usage is monitored in CI, and regression alerts are enabled.

The v1.0.0 build is considered **production-ready**.
