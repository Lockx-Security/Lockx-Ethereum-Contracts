## Introduction

Lockx implements a soulbound NFT lockbox system that fundamentally changes how users secure their digital assets. By separating asset storage from wallet control, Lockx creates a security architecture where wallet compromise does not lead to asset loss.

### The Security Challenge

Self-custody wallets face a fundamental security dilemma:
- **Convenience requires hot wallets** - Keys must be accessible for daily use
- **Security requires cold storage** - Keys should be offline and isolated
- **Users need both** - Security without sacrificing usability

Traditional solutions force users to choose between security and convenience. Hardware wallets are secure but cumbersome. Hot wallets are convenient but vulnerable.

### The Lockx Solution

Lockx introduces a dual-key architecture where:
1. **Wallet keys** control the NFT ownership
2. **Lockbox keys** control the assets inside
3. **Both are required** for any asset movement

This separation means:
- Wallet compromise cannot drain assets
- Lockbox keys can be stored securely offline
- Users maintain convenient access patterns

## Why Testing Matters

Smart contract bugs are permanent and exploits are irreversible. The testing suite validates that:

### 1. The Dual-Key System Works
**What we test**: Every operation requires both NFT ownership AND valid lockbox signature
**Why it matters**: Ensures wallet compromise alone cannot steal assets
**Coverage**: 100% of signature verification paths tested

### 2. Assets Cannot Be Stolen
**What we test**: All withdrawal paths validate ownership, signatures, and balances
**Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized asset extraction
**Coverage**: 87.5% of withdrawal branches covered

### 3. Assets Cannot Be Lost
**What we test**: Deposit tracking, array management, and burn operations
**Why it matters**: Ensures assets remain recoverable
**Coverage**: 84.09% of deposit branches covered

### 4. The System Resists Attacks
**What we test**: Replay attacks, reentrancy, malicious tokens
**Why it matters**: Real-world attacks are prevented
**Coverage**: All critical attack vectors validated

## Testing Methodology

### Unit Testing (160+ tests)
Validates individual functions work correctly in isolation. Each critical function is tested with:
- Valid inputs (success paths)
- Invalid inputs (error paths)
- Edge cases (boundary conditions)
- Attack scenarios (malicious inputs)

### Invariant Testing (26,880 executions)
Validates system properties that must always remain true:
- **Balance Invariant**: Contract ETH equals sum of all lockbox ETH
- **Ownership Invariant**: Assets can only be withdrawn by owners
- **Nonce Invariant**: Signatures cannot be replayed
- **State Invariant**: No operation can corrupt internal state

### Coverage Analysis (81.82%)
Systematic verification that test cases exercise all code paths:
- 198 of 242 branches tested
- All critical security paths covered
- Remaining branches are defensive checks

## Security Properties Validated

### 1. Signature Security (92.86% Coverage)

**Property**: Every operation requires a valid EIP-712 signature from the lockbox key

**What This Prevents**:
- Replay attacks (each signature has a nonce)
- Cross-chain attacks (chain ID is included)
- Signature malleability (EIP-712 structured data)
- Expired operations (timestamp validation)

**Test Example**:
```typescript
it('should reject signature reuse', async () => {
  // First use succeeds
  await lockx.withdrawETH(tokenId, messageHash, signature, ...);
  
  // Second use fails
  await expect(
    lockx.withdrawETH(tokenId, messageHash, signature, ...)
  ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(lockx, 'InvalidSignature');
});
```

### 2. Access Control (100% Coverage)

**Property**: Operations require both NFT ownership and valid signatures

**What This Prevents**:
- Unauthorized access to lockbox contents
- Front-running attacks on operations
- Griefing attacks by non-owners

**Test Example**:
```typescript
it('should reject withdrawal from non-owner', async () => {
  await expect(
    lockx.connect(attacker).withdrawETH(...)
  ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(lockx, 'OwnableUnauthorizedAccount');
});
```

### 3. Asset Integrity (87.88% Coverage)

**Property**: Assets deposited can always be withdrawn by the rightful owner

**What This Prevents**:
- Asset loss due to contract bugs
- Locked funds scenarios
- Accounting errors

**Test Example**:
```typescript
it('should track deposits and allow withdrawal', async () => {
  await lockx.depositERC20(tokenId, token, amount);
  const before = await token.balanceOf(user);
  
  await lockx.withdrawERC20(tokenId, ..., amount);
  const after = await token.balanceOf(user);
  
  expect(after - before).to.equal(amount);
});
```

### 4. Soulbound Protection (100% Coverage)

**Property**: Lockbox NFTs cannot be transferred

**What This Prevents**:
- Theft through NFT marketplace exploits
- Accidental transfers losing access to assets
- Social engineering attacks requesting transfers

**Test Example**:
```typescript
it('should prevent all transfers', async () => {
  await expect(
    lockx.transferFrom(user, attacker, tokenId)
  ).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(lockx, 'TransfersDisabled');
});
```

## Coverage Analysis

### Overall Coverage: 87.19% (211/242 branches)

| Contract | Branch Coverage | Critical Paths | Security Impact |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SignatureVerification.sol | 100% (14/14) | ✓ All paths | Signature validation |
| Lockx.sol | 90.91% (60/66) | ✓ Core paths | Core functionality |
| Withdrawals.sol | 84.75% (100/118) | ✓ Core paths | Asset extraction |
| Deposits.sol | 84.09% (37/44) | ✓ Core paths | Asset storage |

### What the Coverage Means

87.19% branch coverage includes:
1. User-facing functionality
2. Security-critical paths
3. Edge cases and error conditions
4. Attack vectors

### Why Not 100%?

The remaining 12.81% consists of:
1. **Defensive checks** for impossible states (e.g., ERC721 returning address(0))
2. **Redundant validations** in unreachable code paths
3. **Theoretical edge cases** requiring malicious token implementations

Testing these would require creating contracts that violate ERC standards.

## Attack Vector Testing

### 1. Replay Attack Prevention
**Attack**: Reusing a valid signature for multiple withdrawals
**Defense**: Nonce increments with each operation
**Test**: Verified signatures cannot be reused

### 2. Reentrancy Protection
**Attack**: Calling back into contract during withdrawal
**Defense**: State updates before external calls
**Test**: Verified state consistency during callbacks

### 3. Signature Malleability
**Attack**: Modifying signatures to create valid variants
**Defense**: EIP-712 structured data hashing
**Test**: Verified only exact signatures validate

### 4. Access Control Bypass
**Attack**: Attempting operations without ownership
**Defense**: Dual validation of NFT ownership and signatures
**Test**: Verified all operations check both requirements

### 5. Integer Overflow
**Attack**: Causing arithmetic overflows in balances
**Defense**: Solidity 0.8+ automatic checks
**Test**: Verified with maximum value operations

### 6. Denial of Service
**Attack**: Blocking withdrawals with malicious tokens
**Defense**: Try-catch patterns for external calls
**Test**: Verified with reverting token contracts

## Special Scenarios Tested

### Fee-on-Transfer Tokens
Some tokens take fees on transfer. The system correctly accounts for actual received amounts, preventing accounting errors.

### Non-Standard NFTs
The system handles NFTs that don't follow standard patterns, ensuring robust operation across the ecosystem.

### Failed ETH Transfers
When ETH transfers fail (e.g., to contracts rejecting ETH), the system reverts safely without losing funds.

### Array Management
Dynamic arrays are managed correctly even when elements are removed in random order, preventing gaps from corrupting data.

### Enhanced Swap Functionality (v2.4.0)
The swapInLockbox function has been updated with security and usability improvements:

**Recipient Parameter Support**:
- **Direct Transfer**: Swapped tokens can be sent to any recipient address
- **Backward Compatible**: Using address(0) as recipient maintains original behavior (credits lockbox)
- **Signature Protected**: Recipient address is included in signature to prevent tampering
- **Full Asset Support**: Works with both ERC20 and ETH outputs

**Security Enhancements**:
- **Router Overspend Protection**: New RouterOverspent error prevents routers from taking more than authorized
- **Duplicate Entry Detection**: DuplicateEntry error prevents duplicate tokens/NFTs in batch operations
- **Gas Optimization**: Only reset token allowances when necessary to save gas
- **Improved Event Emission**: Simplified SwapExecuted event for better privacy

**Storage Optimization**:
- Removed redundant _erc20Known and _nftKnown mappings
- Direct existence checks using balance/data lookups
- Memory caching for array operations to reduce gas costs

### Advanced Edge Case Testing (v2.3.2)
The testing suite includes edge case validation using malicious contracts:

**Malicious Router Testing** (4 tests):
- **Allowance Cleanup Testing**: Cleanup when external contracts leave partial token allowances
- **ETH Transfer Failure Handling**: Failure scenarios when sending ETH to contracts that reject it
- **Balance Cleanup Verification**: Token removal when balances reach exactly zero
- **Router Behavior Simulation**: Various malicious router behaviors

**SignatureVerification Coverage** (2 tests):
- **AlreadyInitialized Branch**: Double initialization prevention using test harness
- **Complete Branch Coverage**: 100% branch coverage across signature validation logic

These tests cover edge cases that are difficult to reach through normal contract usage.
