# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The **Lockx Contracts** v1.x series currently receives security updates. Older versions are not supported.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 1.x     | ✅        |
| < 1.0   | ❌        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue or pull request**. Instead, email the core team at:

```
security@lockx.app
```

When emailing, please include:

1. **Description** of the issue and potential impact.
2. **Steps** to reproduce or PoC if available.
3. Your preferred **PGP key fingerprint** if you wish to encrypt follow-up.

We aim to respond within **3 business days** and provide a resolution timeline where applicable. Once a fix is available and deployed, we will credit reporters (with consent) in the release notes and Hall of Fame.

## Disclosure Policy

1. We follow a **responsible disclosure** process.
2. Vulnerabilities will be disclosed publicly only **after** a patch release is available and affected parties have had reasonable time to upgrade.
3. Critical issues may warrant an expedited release and coordinated disclosure.

## Bug Bounty

A formal monetary bounty program is in preparation. Until then, we offer **public recognition** for valid security reports and may award discretionary bonuses.
