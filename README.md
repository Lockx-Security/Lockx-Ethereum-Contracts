- **Foundry property testing**: 27 tests (invariants + fuzz) with ~25M randomized operations  
- **Security Coverage**: 100% coverage on signature verification and access control paths
- **Core Contract Coverage**: Lockx.sol achieves 90.54% branch coverage (exceeds 90% target)

**Testing Results:**
```

ðŸ§ª **Testing framework**
- **Systematic Phase Testing**: 20 phase-based test files targeting specific branches
- **Hardhat testing suite** with 90.5% branch coverage and 438 passing tests
- **Foundry testing** with 27 tests (invariants + fuzz) executing ~25 million operations
- **Core functionality testing** with working test files for reliable replication
- **Property-based testing** validating system invariants and balance consistency

ðŸ“Š **Test coverage**
- **Current achievement**: ~90.5% production branch coverage
- **focus**: coverage figures refer to the production contracts only â€” `contracts/Lockx.sol`, `contracts/Withdrawals.sol`, `contracts/Deposits.sol`, `contracts/SignatureVerification.sol`. Aggregates that include `contracts/mocks/**` are not representative of production quality.
- **Working Test Suite**: `systematic-core-suite.spec.ts` (5 passing tests) and systematic phases
- **Foundry Invariants**: 25 million randomized operations across 7 test cases
- **Security Focus**: 100% coverage of signature verification and access control paths
- **Core Contract**: Lockx.sol achieves 90.54% branch coverage (exceeds 90% target)

### Running tests

```bash
# unit testing with coverage
npm run coverage

# invariant and fuzz testing (foundry)
npm run forge:test
```

The first command runs all Hardhat tests (currently 438 passing) with coverage. The second runs Foundry property tests.


**Invariant test results (all passing):**
- Contract ETH balance matches accounting âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Contract ERC20 balance matches accounting âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Nonces are monotonically increasing âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- ERC20 token array indices are consistent âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Multi-user balance consistency âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Array integrity maintained âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- No duplicate addresses in arrays âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)

**Test execution coverage:**
- **25 million operations** executed across 7 invariant tests
- Property-based testing validating core system invariants  
- Statistical confidence in system behavior under all operation sequences
- Balance consistency, array integrity, and nonce monotonicity verified

### Edge-case tests

The test suite includes comprehensive edge-case coverage including:
- Signature verification and replay attack prevention
- Balance validation and arithmetic boundary conditions
- Array manipulation and cleanup scenarios
- Fee-on-transfer token handling
- ETH transfer failure scenarios
- Multi-asset batch operation edge cases

### Testing methodology

The testing approach combines multiple methodologies:
- **Unit testing**: Validates individual functions with predetermined inputs
- **Fuzz testing**: Discovers edge cases through randomized input generation
- **Invariant testing**: Ensures system properties remain true across all state transitions
- **Property-based testing**: Validates mathematical relationships and behavioral correctness

## Static analysis

### Solidity-lint (Solhint)

```bash
npm run lint:sol            # runs solhint over contracts/
```

## Linting & formatting

Prettier (with `prettier-plugin-solidity`) is configured. Format the entire repo:

```bash
npm run format
```

## Deployment

Deploy to any configured network (see `hardhat.config.ts`). Example for Sepolia:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.ts

# verify on Etherscan (API key required in .env)
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>
```

`scripts/deploy.ts` performs a simple deployment of the `Lockx` contract.

## Contract Architecture

### Immutable Design

The Lockx smart contracts are designed to be **immutable** and are not intended to be upgraded once deployed. The contracts do not implement any upgradeability patterns, proxy mechanisms, or administrative upgrade functions.

**Key characteristics:**
- **No proxy contracts**: Direct deployment without upgradeability proxies
- **No admin functions**: No administrative controls for contract modification
- **Immutable logic**: Contract code cannot be changed after deployment
- **Permanent deployment**: Once deployed, the contract behavior is fixed

This design ensures maximum security and predictability, as users can be certain that the contract logic will never change after deployment.

### Gas Optimization

Gas consumption analysis is available for all contract operations:

```bash
npm run gas:report  # generates detailed gas consumption report
```

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file (based on `.env.example`) in the project root:

```
SEPOLIA_RPC=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/yourKey
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/yourKey
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YourEtherscanKey
```

`PRIVATE_KEY` should correspond to the deployer account â€“ **keep it safe**.

## Development & Testing Acknowledgments

This project's comprehensive test suite (46 test files, 438 passing tests, 90.5% branch coverage) was developed through an intensive automated testing approach using Claude AI for systematic test generation and coverage optimization. Over multiple development cycles, Claude assisted with:

- **Automated Unit Test Generation**: Systematic creation of edge case tests and branch coverage optimization
- **Property-Based Test Design**: Development of invariant tests for Foundry integration  
- **Security Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of signature verification, access control, and attack vectors
- **Test Infrastructure**: Professional test organization and documentation

This AI-assisted approach enabled achieving high-quality test coverage that would have required significantly more manual development time, while maintaining rigorous security standards and professional code quality.

The core smart contract logic, architecture, and security design remain entirely human-authored by the Lockx Security team.
