### Running tests

```bash
# Run working core tests (recommended)
npx hardhat test test/systematic-core-suite.spec.ts

# Run systematic phase tests for maximum coverage
npx hardhat test test/systematic-coverage-phase*.spec.ts

# Generate full coverage report (84.3% branch coverage)
npm run coverage

# Run specific working files
npx hardhat test test/systematic-core-suite.spec.ts test/advanced-branch-coverage.spec.ts

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

**Primary Test Files:**

- `systematic-core-suite.spec.ts` - **RELIABLE**: Core working test suite (5 passing tests)
- `systematic-coverage-phase*.spec.ts` - **COMPREHENSIVE**: Phase-based systematic testing (20 files)
- `advanced-branch-coverage.spec.ts` - Advanced branch targeting techniques
- `comprehensive-edge-cases.spec.ts` - Edge case scenarios
- `precision-branch-targeting.spec.ts` - Precision branch hitting strategies

### Foundry testing (Solidity)

```bash
forge test --match-contract Invariant       # runs all invariant tests (25M operations)
forge test --match-contract Invariant -v    # verbose output with gas usage
forge test --match-contract Invariant --profile production  # 250M operations
```

**Invariant test results (all passing):**

- Contract ETH balance matches accounting âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Contract ERC20 balance matches accounting âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Nonces are monotonically increasing âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- ERC20 token array indices are consistent âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Multi-user balance consistency âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- Array integrity maintained âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)
- No duplicate addresses in arrays âœ… (1000 runs Ã— 25,000 calls)

**Test execution coverage:**

- **25 million operations** executed across 7 invariant tests
- Property-based testing validating core system invariants
- Statistical confidence in system behavior under all operation sequences
- Balance consistency, array integrity, and nonce monotonicity verified

### Edge-case tests

The test suite includes comprehensive edge-case coverage including:

- Signature verification and replay attack prevention
- Balance validation and arithmetic boundary conditions
- Array manipulation and cleanup scenarios
- Fee-on-transfer token handling
- ETH transfer failure scenarios
- Multi-asset batch operation edge cases

### Testing methodology

The testing approach combines multiple methodologies:

- **Unit testing**: Validates individual functions with predetermined inputs
- **Fuzz testing**: Discovers edge cases through randomized input generation
- **Invariant testing**: Ensures system properties remain true across all state transitions
- **Property-based testing**: Validates mathematical relationships and behavioral correctness

## Static analysis

### Solidity-lint (Solhint)

```bash
npm run lint:sol            # runs solhint over contracts/
```

## Linting & formatting

Prettier (with `prettier-plugin-solidity`) is configured. Format the entire repo:

```bash
npm run format
```

## Deployment

Deploy to any configured network (see `hardhat.config.ts`). Example for Sepolia:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.ts

# verify on Etherscan (API key required in .env)
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>
```

`scripts/deploy.ts` performs a simple deployment of the `Lockx` contract.

## Contract Architecture

### Immutable Design

The Lockx smart contracts are designed to be **immutable** and are not intended to be upgraded once deployed. The contracts do not implement any upgradeability patterns, proxy mechanisms, or administrative upgrade functions.

**Key characteristics:**

- **No proxy contracts**: Direct deployment without upgradeability proxies
- **No admin functions**: No administrative controls for contract modification
- **Immutable logic**: Contract code cannot be changed after deployment
- **Permanent deployment**: Once deployed, the contract behavior is fixed

This design ensures maximum security and predictability, as users can be certain that the contract logic will never change after deployment.

### Gas Optimization

Gas consumption analysis is available for all contract operations:

```bash
npm run gas:report  # generates detailed gas consumption report
```

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file (based on `.env.example`) in the project root:

```
SEPOLIA_RPC=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/yourKey
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/yourKey
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YourEtherscanKey
```

`PRIVATE_KEY` should correspond to the deployer account â€“ **keep it safe**.
