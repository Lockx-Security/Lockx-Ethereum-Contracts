### Running tests

```bash
# Run all tests (base + swap functionality)
npm test

# Run base functionality tests only
npx hardhat test test/consolidated-coverage.spec.ts

# Run swap functionality tests only
npx hardhat test test/production-ready-swap-tests.spec.ts

# Run coverage analysis (89.36% branch coverage)
npx hardhat coverage --testfiles "test/consolidated-coverage.spec.ts"

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

**Test files:**
- `consolidated-coverage.spec.ts` - Complete test suite achieving 89.36% coverage
- `production-ready-swap-tests.spec.ts` - Comprehensive swap functionality tests
- `swap-functionality.spec.ts` - Basic swap functionality tests
- `core-functionality.spec.ts` - Basic functionality tests
- `mock-contracts.spec.ts` - Mock contract tests

### Foundry testing (Solidity)
```bash
forge test       # runs all invariant tests
forge test -v    # verbose output with gas usage
```

**Invariant test suites:**
- Contract ETH balance matches accounting âœ…
- Contract ERC20 balance matches accounting âœ…
- Nonces are monotonically increasing âœ…
- ERC20 token array indices are consistent âœ…
- Multi-user balance consistency âœ…

**Test execution coverage:**
- Fuzz testing with randomized inputs for edge case discovery
- Property-based testing validating core system invariants
- Comprehensive coverage of batch operations and multi-asset scenarios

### Edge-case tests

The test suite includes comprehensive edge-case coverage including:
- Signature verification and replay attack prevention
- Balance validation and arithmetic boundary conditions
- Array manipulation and cleanup scenarios
- Fee-on-transfer token handling
- ETH transfer failure scenarios
- Multi-asset batch operation edge cases

### Testing methodology

The testing approach combines multiple methodologies:
- **Unit testing**: Validates individual functions with predetermined inputs
- **Fuzz testing**: Discovers edge cases through randomized input generation
- **Invariant testing**: Ensures system properties remain true across all state transitions
- **Property-based testing**: Validates mathematical relationships and behavioral correctness

## Static analysis

### Solidity-lint (Solhint)

```bash
npm run lint:sol            # runs solhint over contracts/
```

## Linting & formatting

Prettier (with `prettier-plugin-solidity`) is configured. Format the entire repo:

```bash
npm run format
```

## Deployment

Deploy to any configured network (see `hardhat.config.ts`). Example for Sepolia:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.ts

# verify on Etherscan (API key required in .env)
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>
```

`scripts/deploy.ts` performs a simple deployment of the `Lockx` contract.

## Contract Architecture

### Immutable Design

The Lockx smart contracts are designed to be **immutable** and are not intended to be upgraded once deployed. The contracts do not implement any upgradeability patterns, proxy mechanisms, or administrative upgrade functions.

**Key characteristics:**
- **No proxy contracts**: Direct deployment without upgradeability proxies
- **No admin functions**: No administrative controls for contract modification
- **Immutable logic**: Contract code cannot be changed after deployment
- **Permanent deployment**: Once deployed, the contract behavior is fixed

This design ensures maximum security and predictability, as users can be certain that the contract logic will never change after deployment.

### Gas Optimization

Gas consumption analysis is available for all contract operations:

```bash
npm run gas:report  # generates detailed gas consumption report
```

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file (based on `.env.example`) in the project root:

```
SEPOLIA_RPC=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/yourKey
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/yourKey
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YourEtherscanKey
```

`PRIVATE_KEY` should correspond to the deployer account â€“ **keep it safe**.
