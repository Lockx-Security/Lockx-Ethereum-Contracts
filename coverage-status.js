🚨 COVERAGE DISASTER RECOVERY STATUS 🚨

PREVIOUS PEAK ACHIEVEMENTS:
✅ Statements: 98.88% 
✅ Branches: 86.78% (210/242)
✅ Functions: 100%
✅ Lines: 99.15%
✅ Lockx.sol: 90.54% branches (EXCEEDED 90% TARGET!)

CURRENT STATE (After Cleanup Disaster):
❌ Statements: 57.57% (Lost 41%)
❌ Branches: 41.91% (Lost 45%) 
❌ Functions: 49.51% (Lost 50%)
❌ Lines: 58.89% (Lost 40%)
❌ Lockx.sol: 60.81% branches (Lost 30%)

WORKING TEST FILES:
✅ test/master-cumulative-90.spec.ts
✅ test/deposits-90-supplement.spec.ts  
✅ test/withdrawals-90-supplement.spec.ts
✅ test/lockx-90-targeted.spec.ts
✅ test/branch-coverage-90-percent.spec.ts

BROKEN/MISSING:
❌ SignatureVerification comprehensive tests (ethers.js issues)
❌ Red team attack scenarios  
❌ Precision branch targeting tests
❌ Advanced EIP-712 signature workflows
❌ Marketing 90% push tests

RECOVERY NEEDED:
🎯 Restore ~30% branch coverage (145/346 → 210/242)
🎯 Restore ~40% statement coverage  
🎯 Restore ~50% function coverage
🎯 Get Lockx.sol back to 90.54% branches
🎯 Get SignatureVerification.sol back to 100% branches

STRATEGY:
1. Create replication script for current 57.57% baseline
2. Build additional working tests to push coverage higher
3. Focus on non-signature dependent branches first
4. Fix signature testing issues to restore SignatureVerification 100%
