# Lockx Smart Contract Testing Report

## Introduction

Lockx is a smart contract system that implements a soulbound NFT lockbox mechanism for secure asset storage. The system utilizes ERC-5192 soulbound non-fungible tokens that serve as containers for various digital assets including ETH, ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 NFTs. Each lockbox operates with multi-key security architecture and EIP-712 signature validation to ensure controlled access to stored assets.

Self-custody represents the fundamental principle of decentralized finance, allowing users to maintain direct control over their assets without relying on centralized exchanges or hosted wallet services. However, self-custody introduces significant security challenges that must be addressed through robust technical solutions.

## Problem Statement

Traditional self-custody solutions face several critical security vulnerabilities:

**Single Point of Failure**: Most wallets rely on a single private key, creating a catastrophic failure point where key compromise results in total asset loss.

**Malware and Trojans**: Wallet drainer malware can extract private keys from compromised devices, enabling attackers to drain all associated assets.

**Phishing Attacks**: Sophisticated phishing attempts can trick users into signing malicious transactions or revealing sensitive information.

**Private Key Compromise**: Once a private key is exposed through any vector, all assets controlled by that key become immediately vulnerable.

**Existing Solutions Limitations**: While hardware wallets and multisig wallets provide enhanced security, they significantly compromise user experience through complex setup processes, transaction delays, and operational overhead.

## Solution Overview

The Lockx system addresses these security challenges through a lockbox architecture that separates asset storage from wallet security:

**Soulbound Token Container**: Assets are stored within ERC-5192 soulbound NFTs that cannot be transferred, preventing unauthorized movement of the container itself.

**Separate Key Architecture**: Each lockbox maintains its own dedicated key separate from the wallet's primary private key, isolating asset access from wallet compromise.

**Multi-Key Security**: The system implements dual-key validation requiring both ownership verification and lockbox-specific key authorization.

**EIP-712 Signature Validation**: All operations require structured signature validation, preventing unauthorized access even if individual keys are compromised.

**Granular Access Control**: Users can perform specific operations (deposits, withdrawals, key rotation) without exposing the entire asset portfolio to risk.

## Test Methodologies In-Depth

### 1. Unit Testing
**What it is**: Unit testing validates individual functions and components in isolation, testing both success and failure scenarios with predetermined inputs and expected outputs.

**How it's performed**: Each test creates a controlled environment with specific contract states, calls functions with known parameters, and validates the results against expected outcomes.

**Examples of tests performed**:
- **Lockbox Creation**: Testing `createLockboxWithETH()` with valid parameters, verifying the lockbox is created with correct owner, key, and ETH balance
- **Asset Deposits**: Testing `depositERC20()` with approved tokens, validating balance updates and event emissions
- **Signature Validation**: Testing EIP-712 signature verification with valid and invalid signatures, ensuring proper nonce management
- **Access Control**: Testing ownership requirements for operations like `getFullLockbox()`, ensuring only token owners can access data

**Specific test example**:
```typescript
it('should create lockbox with ETH', async () => {
  const tx = await lockx.connect(user).createLockboxWithETH(
    user.address, lockboxKey.address, ethers.ZeroHash, 
    { value: ethers.parseEther('1') }
  );
  
  const lockboxData = await lockx.connect(user).getFullLockbox(tokenId);
  expect(lockboxData.ethBalance).to.equal(ethers.parseEther('1'));
});
```

### 2. Fuzz Testing
**What it is**: Fuzz testing automatically generates randomized inputs within specified ranges to discover edge cases and unexpected behaviors that manual testing might miss.

**How it's performed**: The testing framework generates hundreds or thousands of random input combinations, executing the same test logic with different parameters to identify boundary conditions and input validation issues.

**Examples of tests performed**:
- **ETH Deposit Fuzzing**: Testing `createLockboxWithETH()` with random ETH amounts from 0 to 10 ETH to ensure balance accounting remains accurate
- **Batch Operation Fuzzing**: Testing `createLockboxWithBatch()` with random combinations of ETH amounts, ERC20 token amounts, and NFT inclusion
- **Withdrawal Amount Fuzzing**: Testing withdrawal functions with random amounts to verify proper balance validation and cleanup

**Specific test example**:
```solidity
function testFuzz_ethDeposit(uint96 amount) public {
    vm.assume(amount > 0 && amount < 10 ether);
    
    vm.prank(user);
    lockx.createLockboxWithETH{value: amount}(user, lockboxKey, referenceId);
    
    assertEq(address(lockx).balance, amount);
}
```

### 3. Invariant Testing
**What it is**: Invariant testing validates that certain properties or conditions remain true throughout all possible state transitions, regardless of the sequence of operations performed.

**How it's performed**: The testing framework continuously executes random sequences of valid operations while checking that fundamental system properties are never violated.

**Examples of tests performed**:
- **ETH Balance Invariant**: Ensuring the contract's ETH balance always equals the sum of all lockbox ETH balances
- **ERC20 Accounting Invariant**: Verifying that token balances stored in contract mappings match actual token contract balances
- **Nonce Invariant**: Ensuring nonces always increment correctly and are never reused
- **Array Consistency Invariant**: Validating that array manipulations maintain proper indexing and element relationships

**Specific test example**:
```solidity
function invariant_contractEthMatchesAccounting() public view {
    uint256 stored = lockx.getEthBal(0);
    assertEq(address(lockx).balance, stored);
}
```

### 4. Property-Based Testing
**What it is**: Property-based testing validates high-level behavioral properties and mathematical relationships that should hold true across all valid inputs and states.

**How it's performed**: Tests define properties as mathematical assertions and verify these properties hold across large input spaces, often combining with fuzz testing for comprehensive coverage.

**Examples of tests performed**:
- **Deposit-Withdrawal Symmetry**: Verifying that depositing X amount and immediately withdrawing X amount returns the system to its original state
- **Batch Operation Equivalence**: Ensuring batch operations produce the same final state as equivalent individual operations
- **Signature Uniqueness**: Validating that each signature can only be used once and produces deterministic results
- **State Transition Consistency**: Ensuring all valid operation sequences lead to consistent final states
